This is the introduction of the essay "V2X-Mamba: Cooperative Perception Network Based on Mamba for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Domain Difference Information Fusion". 
Until now, the manuscript is under review, we will only upload the core code after the manuscript is accepted, and we will upload the whole rest of the structure. 
On that basis, we extend the training form of the raw codes. Now, we can use parallel training with multi-GPU to save training time. 
Above all, if you have any questions about the code, you can communicate with me.
